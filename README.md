> **An autonomous dual-gate waste sorting system powered by YOLOv8, Raspberry Pi, and 8 precision servos.**  
> Designed to **identify and sort waste** into “Recyclable” or “Landfill” bins in real time.

## 🧠 Overview  

The **Automated YOLOv8 Waste Sorter** combines **AI-based object detection**, **embedded hardware control**, and **mechanical automation**.  
A **custom YOLOv8 model** detects items through the Pi Camera, and a **Finite State Machine (FSM)** controls servo-driven gates and bins to sort waste automatically.  

This system ensures **continuous, one-by-one item processing** using two alternating gates for uninterrupted operation.  

---

## 🌟 Key Features  

### ⚡ Real-Time Classification  
- Detects and classifies waste instantly using a **custom-trained YOLOv8 model**.  
- Powered by **Ultralytics YOLOv8** and optimized for Raspberry Pi.  

### 🔀 Dual-Gate System  
- Two alternating gates (`Gate 1`, `Gate 2`) ensure **non-stop item flow**.  
- While one gate is closed and detecting, the other prepares for the next item.  

### ⚙️ Balanced 8-Servo Architecture  
| Component | Servos | Purpose |
|------------|---------|----------|
| ♻️ Recyclable Bin | 2 | Balanced lid lift |
| 🗑️ Landfill Bin | 2 | Balanced lid lift |
| 🚪 Gate 1 | 2 | Hold and release items |
| 🚪 Gate 2 | 2 | Hold and release items |

### 🧩 Robust Finite State Machine (FSM)  
| State | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **CLOSED** | Detect & classify object |
| **WAITING_CLEAR** | Wait for object to leave view |
| **OPENING** | Open active gate for next item |
| **OPEN** | Hold open, close, and toggle gate |

### 🧱 Raspberry Pi Optimized  
- Uses `RPi.GPIO` for precise hardware control.  
- Uses `picamera2` for efficient image streaming.  
- Lightweight and fully compatible with **Raspberry Pi 4/5**.

## 💾 Installation  

### 1️⃣ Clone Repository  
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Rie109/Hackathon.git
cd Hackathon
```

### 2️⃣ Install Dependencies  
```bash
pip install ultralytics opencv-python-headless RPi.GPIO picamera2
```

If `picamera2` fails to install:
```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt install -y python3-picamera2
```

### 3️⃣ Add Your YOLOv8 Model  
Place your trained model file `best.pt` at:  
```
/home/harry/Hackathon/best.pt
```
Or modify this line in the script:
```python
MODEL_PATH = '/your/path/to/best.pt'
```

---

## 🚀 Run the System  

Execute the main script:  
```bash
python waste_sorter.py
```

You’ll see this startup menu:  
```
RASPBERRY PI WASTE DETECTION SYSTEM - BALANCED BIN VERSION
===========================================================

1. Run detection (with display)
2. Run detection (headless - no display)
3. Run detection + servo control (with display)
4. Run detection + servo control (headless)
0. Exit
```

💡 **Tip:**  
- Use **1 or 2** to test camera and detection accuracy.  
- Use **3 or 4** for full sorting system with all 8 servos.  

---

## ⚙️ Configuration  

Tweak angles and timings at the top of the script:  
```python
SERVO_CLOSED_ANGLE = 90
SERVO_OPEN_ANGLE   = 45
GATE_CLOSED_ANGLE  = 90
GATE_OPEN_ANGLE    = 45

bin_open_duration = 2.5  # seconds
clear_wait_time   = 1.0  # seconds
```

---

## ⚠️ Known Issues / Improvements  

- Current version uses `time.sleep()` in servo control, causing short **camera freeze** periods.  
- Next iteration: implement **non-blocking timers** for smoother detection.  
- Future goal: add **more waste categories** and **adaptive gate control** for improved accuracy.
